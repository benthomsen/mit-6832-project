## Trajectory Optimization and Time-Varying LQR Stabilization of Airplane Longitudinal Dynamics
### Underactuated Robotics Class Project, Spring 2018

This core of this project is trajectory optimization and time-varying LQR stabilization of the nonlinear longitudinal dynamics of a small, light, fixed-wing aircraft. First, a six-state nonlinear model of the longitudinal aircraft dynamics, with elevator and thrust inputs, is developed and parameterized. Trajectory optimization with input and state constraints is carried out using both direct transcription and direct collocation methods. Time-varying LQR stabilization around this nominal trajectory is carried out, to account for discretization error and for parametric uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics. Region of attraction estimation, via sums-of-squares verification is attempted but not fully implemented in its current state. Kinodynamic sampling-based motion planning, via an RRT*-like method is carried out to find dynamically feasible trajectories which avoid obstacles in the vertical plane.
